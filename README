This is a modification of the /prog/scrape program originally written by Koen Crolla <cairnarvon@gmail.com>.
It differs in that it supports the newer python 2.6 and it stores the data in Unicode. Unfortunately, this
makes it incompatible with any existing prog.db you may have. I have included a dump of my prog.db which is
accurate as of Aug 15 20:13:37 BST 2009. To regain the data in the correct format use the command

	sqlite3 prog.db < sqldump

Alternatively, you could generate a fresh database, although this will take a number of hours and is not recommended.
Support for newer versions of Python, including Python 3.x is planned for the future.
